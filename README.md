# QlikView Extension - Better Current Selections Box (Hiding/Translating Fields)

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/stefanwalther/qvBetterCurrentSelectionsBox.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
**_Better Current Selections Box_** is an advanced selection box for QlikView with the ability to hide and translate fields and to select different icons.

## Purpose and Description
* Did you ever want to translate fields in the _Current SelectionBox_ in QlikView?
* Did you ever want to hide fields beyond those with the prefix defined in _SET HidePrefix = '%';_ in your _Current SelectionBox_?
* Did you ever want to display different icons than the _out of the box_ icons?
* etc.

You have probably realized that these requirements are not that easy to meet. So enough reasons for creating this solution.
